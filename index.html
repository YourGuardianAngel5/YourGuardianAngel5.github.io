    <h7>               Dead By Daylight is an extremely popular game released worldwide on June 16th in 2016. It is one of the first games of its kind and offers an experience unlike any other game ever released before. You play a game of cat and mice. 4 survivors have to work together to face off against one killer. Everyone is contained inside a giant maze of rubble, ruined buildings, and abandoned vehicles like tractors and cars. The survivors have to repair 5 generators to get the power on all throughout the map and to power the exit gates so they may escape. The killer's job is to stop them using their special abilities, sacrifice them to the Entity on meat hooks, and to generally scare them really badly. The killer can never die and they can only be slowed down in their chases. A game where you as the survivor cannot fight back, you can only run and hide. Which one will you choose? Don't get caught.</h7>
